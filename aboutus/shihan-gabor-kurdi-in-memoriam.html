            <p>The International Hayashi-Ha Shito-Ryu Karate-do Federation
                remembers, with pride and great sadness, one of the Founders of
                Hungarian Karate whose contributions to the development of, and
                cultivation to, Karate will remain significantly impactful. At
                every level, as practitioner, instructor, and community leader,
                Shihan Kurdi illustrated his multi-faceted interests, tremendous
                motivation and the institutional savvy that successfully helped
                bring Karatedo as an art and sport to public forums.</p>

            <p>As a young man, Gabor Kurdi invested focus upon academics; he
                graduated as an electrical engineer while reconciling his pursuit
                of a broad scope of martial arts throughout the 60s and 70s. While
                today we often take such information for granted, the gleaning of
                'secret' information-or that which was once certainly obscure
                technical instruction- required intense personal motivation. There
                are enumerable hallmarks and anecdotal stories that will be
                enthusiastically shared of Shihan Kurdi but everyone will certainly
                attest to this man's will power. His was an ability to 'hang his
                hat' on an idea, organize by all matter and means to feature his
                beloved Karate, and ensure successful outcomes. Such motivation was
                also a trademark testament to Kurdi in his pursuit of knowledge; he
                sought training within a wide spectrum of martial art systems
                inclusive of Judo, ju-Jitsu, and Kendo. The first exposure to
                Karate was within the Shotokan system.</p>

            <p>Following his enthusiasm for Karate, his dojo was established in
                Budapest, Hungary in 1977. As world level competitions grew within
                a newly established world organization (WUKO), Budapest, Hungary
                was chosen for the location for the 1984 World Cup. Sensei Kurdi
                naturally took part in organizational matters that featured
                stunning organizational framework, full stadiums, and seamless
                timing, and latest technology on display. Cultural infusions and
                entertainment fused with exceptional attention to hospitality,
                media savvy/exposure and seamless execution. Serendipitously, the
                United States fielded their USA Karate National Team with Julius
                Thiry as member of the WUKO Referee Council. He also was the
                instructor of three of the fielded American athletes. Shihan Kurdi
                kindly offered Shihan Thiry his dojo as a place that could
                accommodate personal training. Naturally, courtesies included
                Shihan Thiry sharing the training and techniques within the scope
                of a joint practice and observation in the days preceding the
                competition. It was then that Kurdi made the decision to request
                membership under the tutelage of Thiry. The USA team won their
                silver medals and Hayashi-Ha Shito-Ryu was born in Hungary. Gabor
                Kurdi never loss momentum. His engine ran enthusiastically on full
                speed. Never short of exploring and expanding Karate at all levels,
                Kurdi authored books-historical references and even teaching tools
                for the onslaught of the youngest of students. Enumerable
                additional hallmark events brought international seminars, events
                and competitions for all ages and skill levels to Hungary for
                decades… until the present. Earning the rank of a Sichi-dan, Kurdi
                was awarded the title of Shihan in 2005 in recognition of the
                plethora of productivity as a student, teacher, and active citizen
                in all the communities of which he was a part.</p>

            <p>As Vice President of International Hayashi-Ha Shito-Ryu
                Karate-Do Federation since 2008, one of our treasured citizens has
                passed to us a hard won baton carried for nearly half a century, to
                his own finish line. Able to witness many of the fruits of his long
                labors, Shihan Kurdi has left many legacies worth honoring. We
                remember his legacy of mischief and fun, a stubborn insistence on
                novel ideas with or without a consensus, an ability to
                authentically address anyone in any arena without
                hesitation…characteristics that might not seem meaningful until one
                grasps the requisites for successful outcomes. It's not always the
                imaginative ideas. It's the stuff of Shihan Kurdi--come hell or
                high water, he doesn't mind the requisite disruption of correctly
                framing and finishing an entire project. As a standard bearer of
                follow through, for his grasp of life's greatest meanings and for
                his curiosity and generosity, may we always honor Shihan Gabor
                Kurdi and share often our warmest stories.</p>

            <p>Our heartfelt condolences goes out to his wife Dr. Nora Tancsa
                and his son Ferenc Kurdi.</p>
