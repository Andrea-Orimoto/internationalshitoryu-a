      <p><strong>A SHORT INTRODUCTION TO OUR FEDERATION</strong></p>

      <p>The mission of the International Hayashi-ha Shito-ryu Karate-do
        Federation is to preserve, promote and exemplify the classical
        Karate-do philosophy and teachings of <a href="/aboutus/organization-chart/hayashi-teruo/"
          title="Hayashi Teruo">Soke Teruo Hayashi</a>. Soke ("Grandmaster")
        Teruo Hayashi, the founder of Hayashi-ha Shito-Ryu Karate was one
        of the most prominent figures in modern Karate-do. During his
        lifetime, he studied and adapted many different styles of Okinawan
        and Japanese Karate. His system of Karate-do was studied
        world-wide, with branches on every continent. He also included a
        system of traditional Okinawan weapons arts, known as Kenshin-ryu
        Kobudo. Soke Hayashi passed away in 2004, at the age of 79.</p>

      <p>Hanshi ("Master") <a href="/aboutus/organization-chart/julius-thiry/" title="Julius Thiry">Julius Thiry</a> was
        one of Soke Hayashi's
        most senior students, having trained with him for over 45 years.
        Hanshi Thiry is an 9<sup><span>th</span></sup> <span>dan Karate
          practitioner and instructor who received his rank and status
          directly from Soke Teruo Hayashi. During Soke Hayashi's lifetime,
          Hanshi Thiry was responsible for the development and practice of
          Hayashi-ha style Karate-do in the United States, South America, and
          Eastern Europe. He personally trained numerous national and
          international Karate Champions for the United States.</span></p>

      <p>In addition, Hanshi Thiry was the founder and three time
        President of the USA National Karate-do Federation ("USANKF").
        Under his leadership, in 1999, the USANKF was accepted by the
        United States Olympic Committee as the National Governing Body for
        the sport of Karate, a status which has continued to this date.
        While Hanshi Thiry was President of the USANKF, the status of
        United States Karate rose to that of Pan- American Champions and
        was ranked third in the world.</p>

      <p>The International Hayashi-ha Shito-ryu Karate-do Federation
        ("Federation") was founded in 2005 by Hanshi Thiry to preserve and
        teach the Karate-do and Kobudo which had been passed to him by Soke
        Teruo Hayashi. The Federation is a non-profit organization with
        member national federations and clubs in the United States,
        Hungary, Rumania, Japan and South America. The Board of Directors
        for the Federation is composed of the Presidents of the National
        Federations and the officers of the corporation. The Federation
        also maintains standing committees to facilitate competition and
        educational seminars.</p>

      <p>Hanshi Thiry serves as the Chairman of the Federation as well as
        the Chair of the Technical Committee. As such, he personally
        supervises the administration and the technical proficiency of the
        Federation members to be sure that they adhere to the standards of
        Hayashi-ha Karate-do.</p>
