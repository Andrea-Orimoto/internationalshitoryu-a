    <p>Soke Teruo Hayashi is one of the greatest and most famous
      masters of modern Karate. He is the founder, active headmaster and
      president of "Hayashi-Ha Shito-Ryu Kai School of Karate-do" and
      "Japan Kobudo Kenshin-Ryu-Kai", and has its headquarters in Osaka,
      Japan. Hayashi was born in Nara, the old capital of Japan in the
      island of Honshu, in 1924. At age 14 began his martial arts
      training in judo having earned the rank of San Dan. At the age of
      24 and after the war, he discovered Gojuryu karate and studied
      under Seiko Higa from 1949 to 1951 (Seiko Higa was a disciple of
      Chojun Miyagi and Kangyo Higaonna).</p>

    <p>He has throughout his adult life displayed a fervor for learning
      karate perhaps matched only by one of his teachers, Kenwa Mabuni.
      His style is the result of over fifty years of research into and
      refining of the numerous Okinawan and Japanese Karate styles
      Hayashi Soke has studied over his amazing lifetime. Starting in
      Osaka, Japan, the birthplace of Shito-Ryu, Hayashi Soke studied
      under Kosei Kuniba, a chief disciple of Shito-Ryu's founder, Kenwa
      Mabuni. Hayashi Soke did study briefly with Mabuni, but his daily
      instruction came from Kuniba, at least at first. It was not long,
      however, before the young Hayashi outgrew the experience Osaka had
      to offer.</p>

    <p>Certainly, there were many kata to learn, and technique can
      never be perfected, but what the young Hayashi wanted most was new
      challenges, new faces to kumite with. Also, he knew Karate's
      history. Karate came from Okinawa. His teacher came from Okinawa.
      His teacher's teacher came from Okinawa. He must go to Okinawa! So
      it was that Hayashi Teruo, a young man with much ambition, set out
      to master the world, his opponents, and himself.</p>

    <p>Hayashi took what may seem to Westerner's as an insane approach
      to choosing the Dojo at which to study. He would walk into the Dojo
      and challenge the Sensei to a fight. This, of course, incensed any
      students present at the time and they would insist on a chance to
      teach the chap a lesson themselves before their beloved Sensei
      would reduce himself to accepting a challenge from an upstart. This
      practice, some might say brave, others foolish, is actually a time
      honored tradition in Japanese and Okinawan cultures. It is known as
      Dojo Yaburi (challenge). While not practiced frequently these days,
      it was actually a common protocol when Hayashi was a young man. The
      way it worked was simple. The man that issued the challenge must
      first fight the lowest ranking man at the Dojo. If the challenger
      defeats the man then he is granted the right to fight the next
      lowest ranking man, and so on until the challenger is defeated or
      has himself defeated the Dojo's Senpai (number one student). Then
      and only then is he allowed to challenge the Sensei himself, but is
      usually given the right to choose time and place as a reward for
      his previous efforts.</p>

    <p>Hayashi became infamous for this practice, and resulting in
      being, very good at kumite. So much so that many Dojo refused his
      challenges outright and would not let them inside their doors.
      There were, of course, those that accepted. If Hayashi was beaten
      at one of these schools he would stay and ask for training. After
      all, what did he have to learn from those he himself had beaten! It
      was in this way that Hayashi sought not only knowledge, but respect
      from the Okinawans.</p>

    <p>As a result of his tenacity Hayashi was able to garner much
      experience while on Okinawa. His primary teachers while on Okinawa
      were Nagamine Shoshin and Nakaima Kenko. From Nagamine Sensei he
      learned both the Shuri and Tomari lineages of kata. These kata tend
      to emphasize long linear stances and quick motion between stances.
      It was from this man that Hayashi learned the white crane form,
      Hakkaku.</p>

    <p>From Nakaima Sensei, Hayashi learned a obscure family art called
      Ryuei-Ryu. This style is a southern tiger style imported from China
      four generations prior to Hayashi's arrival on Okinawa. After a
      year of proving himself to the revered Nakaima, Hayashi was the
      first non-family member allowed to study the style. Hayashi
      incorporates much of Ryuei-Ryu's theory into his own system.</p>

    Upon returning to Japan, Hayashi continued his study with Kuniba
    Kosei. From Kuniba, Hayashi learned the bulk of the Shito-Ryu
    syllabus, and as such it was the Shito-Ryu versions of the Naha
    kata that Hayashi was taught and still teaches. Hayashi was
    Kuniba's number one student, and it was on his deathbed that Kuniba
    asked Hayashi to run his organization until his young son, Shogo,
    reached a level of maturity to assume leadership of the
    organization. Honoring his Sensei's wishes, Hayashi became
    President of the Seishin-Kai until 1970 at which time Hayashi
    handed the mantle of leadership to the style's rightful heir,
    Kuniba Shogo, and founded his own style called Hayashi-Ha
    Shito-Ryu.
