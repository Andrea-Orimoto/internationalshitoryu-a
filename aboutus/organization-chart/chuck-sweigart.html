    <span>Chuck Sweigart began his training in 1981 after college. It
      was a late start by today's standards, but I don't ever remember
      seeing a Dojo anywhere in the area back then. I wanted to learn
      Karate because of my heritage, mental focus, and self-defense. I
      had no idea what an impact it would have on my life, and eventually
      others. I earned black belt in shotokan Karate and then joined the
      WKA in 1987. I immediately fell in love with the are because of the
      explosive but efficient movements.</span>

    <p>I became passionate about competing and trained hard enough to
      win the National Championship in 1995, 96, and 97. Parallel to my
      competition career, I was selected to become the Sensei at the WKA
      Lakewood Dojo in 1995. I began to concentrate on developing the
      school, judging, and refereeing. In 1997, I received National
      Kumite Referee from the USANKF. I served on the USANKF Board of
      Directors ad the Shito-Ryu representative from 1994-2007.</p>

    <p>After attending my first Pan-American Championships in the
      Dominican Republic in 1998, I earned the level of Pan-American
      Referee. I was told that it was only the second time in the history
      of the Pan-American Karate Federation that anyone jumped to the top
      level on the first try. In 2001 I was placed on the USANKF Referee
      Committee. this has been a tremendous responsibility as this
      committee is in charge of the testing, educating, and guiding all
      referees and judges in the USA for both kata and kumite. It also is
      accountable for insuring that the rules are enforced based on
      traditional karate concepts.</p>

    <p>In 2004 I received the highest kumite referee license from the
      World Karate Federation. Shortly after, I passed for Kata judge A
      and became one of only seven Americans to hold the WKF Karate
      Referee license. One of the highlights along this journey was being
      selected to referee in the gold medal match, in front of 12,000
      spectators, at the world Championships in Mexico.</p>

    <p>I recently attended the world championships in Tokyo, Japan at
      the famous Budokan. While there, I was able to spend time with my
      relatives and learned that my Grandmother was "Bushi" or Samurai.
      Karate has been such a vital part of my life so learning that I had
      direct lineage with a Samurai clan made so much sense as to why I
      had this strong passion and enthusiasm for it. I have always been
      fascinated with the way of the Samurai and now, with this
      connection, I feel that it is my destiny to continue and to educate
      students to be disciplined, respectful, and to be contributing
      citizens to society and always strive for excellence in every part
      of their life. this pursuit of excellence is a quality that
      champions of all walks of life embrace and remember that a black
      belt is just a white belt that never quit.</p>
