    <p><span>William Chao's business interests are focused on three
        principal industries comprised of municipal capital markets,
        international business development and real estate development and
        ownership</span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span>For over 26 years in the municipal capital markets sector,
        William Chao has specialized in municipal reinvestment of bond
        proceeds and derivative product advisory for public agencies. Mr.
        Chao is one of the preeminent municipal reinvestment and derivative
        product specialists in the country and has been a pioneer and
        instrumental in the development of both the municipal reinvestment
        industry as well as the evolution of municipal derivative products.
        In 1998 Mr. Chao in conjunction with JP Morgan &amp; Co. developed
        the first letter of credit to incorporate derivative technology and
        embed municipal derivative products. Mr. Chao is one of the
        nation's largest managers of municipal bond proceeds and derivative
        products. Since 1981, Mr. Chao has personally placed over $75
        billion in municipal reinvestment and derivative product
        transactions. These transactions involved municipal interest rate
        swaps, caps, floors, rate locks, swaptions and other and option
        based products. On the municipal reinvestment side of the business,
        the products have included investment agreements, collateralized
        repurchase agreements, forward purchase agreements, flexible
        certificates of deposit and advance refunding escrow procurement.
        In 2010 Mr. Chao completed the placement of over $800,000,000 of
        investments for the Barclays Center, a state-of-the art sports and
        entertainment facility and future home of the NBA Nets. Barclays
        Center is part of a $4.9 billion mixed use development project
        known as Atlantic Yards in downtown Brooklyn.</span></p>

    <p><span>In the international business development sector, Mr. Chao
        is the Seattle based partner of Mr. Manny Menendez. Together, they
        founded Noble Pacific Holdings LLC. The firm specializes in
        strategic advisory, business development and government relations
        in Asia with China as the Crown Jewel. Mr. Chao manages the
        oversight of North American clients, strategic business alliances
        and other business operations focusing primarily on the China/Asian
        market.</span></p>

    <p><span>Mr. Chao is also involved in real estate development and
        ownership, primarily in the Seattle/Pacific Northwest region with
        principal focus on multi-family housing and historic tax-credit
        properties.</span></p>
