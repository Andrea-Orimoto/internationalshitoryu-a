    <p>Bernard J. Dougherty is the master instructor (Shihan) of
      Kobayashi Dojo. Shihan Dougherty is a 36-year practitioner of
      Hayashi-Ha Shito-Ryu Karate-Do. He currently holds the rank of
      Nana-dan (seventh degree Black Belt) in International Hayashi-Ha
      Shito-Ryu&nbsp;Karate-do Federation (IHSKF) and holds the rank of
      San-Dan (third degree Black Belt in Kenshin-Ryu Okinawa Kobudo
      (weapons).</p>

    <p>Shihan has faithfully served the long tradition and has
      undergone a long apprenticeship in order to achieve the level of
      expertise that Hayashi-Ha Shito-Ryu requires of its students to
      become designated a Shihan (master instructor). Traditional
      Japanese Karate styles such as Hayashi-Ha Shito-Ryu require longer
      periods of study than other more modern styles of martial arts
      before advancement in the Dan (black belt) ranks.</p>

    <p>Shihan Dougherty has demonstrated the stamina, determination,
      and persistence worthy of his teaching status, and is willing to
      instill these qualities in his students no matter what the age. He
      has trained extensively in the United States and Japan directly
      under Grand Master Hayashi and his top ranked Japanese National and
      International coaches and competitors.</p>

    <p>A 50-year resident of Lee County, Florida, Shihan Dougherty is
      very involved in the community in which he lives. He is committed
      to providing quality teaching to students of all ages in order to
      promote not only Hayashi-Ha Shito-Ryu, but also the welfare of the
      community, promote social interest and responsibility, combating
      juvenile delinquency, and encouraging adult mentors to council,
      assist, and encourage youth to learn, advance, and make positive
      life choices.</p>
