    <p><span><span>Shihan Gabor Kurdi was born in 1942 in Budapest,
          Hungary. He graduated as an Electrical Engineer and worked in that
          field while studying a wide range of martial arts throughout the
          60s and 70s. His interests and training have included Judo,
          Ju-Jitsu, Kendo and Shotokan karate. In the early eighties, he was
          privy to Hayashi-ha Shito-Ryu training when Hanshi Thiry arrived in
          Budapest for the World Cup being held there. Shihan Kurdi kindly
          offered his dojo as a place for practice for the American Team
          members training under Thiry. It was then that he made the decision
          to become a member of the Hayashi-ha Shito-Ryu organization under
          Thiry. A holder of a Roku-Dan, Kurdi was awarded the title of
          Shihan in 2005 in recognition of his contributions to the
          organization and karate communities at large.</span></span></p>
