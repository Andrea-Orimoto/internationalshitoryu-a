    <span>Sensei Matsuura has been a karate practitioner since a young
      boy in the Gifu prefecture in central Japan since introduced by his
      father to the art as a very young boy. At ten years of age, his
      instructor Takenori Tanaka was his instructor in Shotokan
      Karate.<span>&nbsp;</span> Under Sensei Tanaka,<span>&nbsp;</span>
      he was awarded his initial black belt. Post high school years,
      Sensei Matsuura moved to Osaka where he met Grand Master (Soke)
      Hayashi. Grand Master Hayashi agreed to accept him into his dojo
      albeit as a beginning student. The requirement was that he enters
      training as a novice white belt.</span><br />

        until earning his black belt in Hayashi Ha Shito- ryu.</span></p>

    <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0in 0in 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><span>It was in 1986 that he was recruited
        from
        Japan by Hanshi Thiry to instruct Karate and to help his efforts of
        quality control in Washington Karate Association schools, as
        Hanshi's duties of Referee Council chair and national/international
        commitments increased. From that time until 2000, Sensei Matsuura
        was the head instructor at the Washington Karate Association's
        Ballard location.</span></p>

        the
        WKA in order to pursue his business development plans in
        international trade although he was able to reconcile teaching
        karate and his career as he travelled.</span></p>
