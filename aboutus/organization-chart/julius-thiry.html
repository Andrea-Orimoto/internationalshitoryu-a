    <p>Julius Thiry was born in Budapest, Hungary and escaped to
      Austria as an anti-communist Freedom Fighter in 1956 post the
      failed revolution of that time. From Austria, he then moved to
      Germany to continue his higher education. Since his early
      childhood, Thiry was always very involved in sports ranging from
      tennis to ice hockey. But, he excelled the most in boxing and at
      16, was recruited as a junior member of the Hungarian Army Team. He
      pursued his interest in martial arts in Germany at University via a
      fellow student.</p>

    <p>His training began with Shotokan Karate and continued for
      several years. After immigrating to the United States, Thiry
      decided to pursue his interest in Japanese Karate by commuting to
      and living in Japan and Okinawa. Once settled in Seattle,
      Washington, Thiry established the Washington Karate Association in
      1966.</p>

    <p>Thousands of students have gleaned important life lessons under
      his tutelage. The sport at large has benefited from his largesse
      and energy as he founded and promoted the first IOC recognized
      National Governing Body for the sport of Karate in the USA. Under
      Thiry's political and technical guidance, the USA grew into a
      formidable presence in the world of Karate. Within his own
      organization, the WKA produced countless international champions
      garnering awards, accolades and medals from the World Karate
      Federation, World Championships, The World Games, Pan American
      Championships and United States National Championships.</p>

    <p><em>"One of my greatest joys"</em> states Thiry, <em>"is to
        witness these amazing young men and women become pro-active and
        contributing citizens of their respective communities."</em></p>
